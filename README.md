Following along with The Odin Project, this repo is a project in the course in which I will create a web design from scratch following a design they expect me (the student) to replicate. In this project I'll continue to enhance my CSS and HTML skills. 

- In this project we're advised not to focus on making the mobile page variation of the webpage look neat, thus I haven't. This would be perhaps a focus of mine going forward in order to make it look better.
